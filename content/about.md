Vignette is a website that features interviews of the beautiful people that use R. It is inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com), a great website by [Daniel Bogan](https://waferbaby.com/). 

The interviews are meant to be relatively short and nerdy. For proper interviews, check out [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/category/my-r-journey/) and the [.rpofile](https://ropensci.org/tags/rprofile/) series.

My name is Georgios and you can find me on [karaman.is](https://karaman.is/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/geokaramanis) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gkaramanis/vignette_md).
